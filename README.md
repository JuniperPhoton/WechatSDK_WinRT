# WechatSDK_WinRT

This project is generated by decompiling from Wechat SDK for WP8, which targets only to Windows Phone 8 Silverlight apps, and I just convert all the Silverlight API to Runtime version.

By using this SDK, please follow the steps(Assume that you are familar with Visual Studio):

1. Include MicroMsg.sdk in your Solution;
2. Add reference of MicrosoMsg.sdk to your Windows Phone project(Note that Windows 8.1 project is out of list);
3. In your .cs file: 

    using MicroMsg;

          try
            {
            int scene = SendMessageToWX.Req.WXSceneChooseByUser; //发给微信朋友
            
            var message = new WXImageMessage();
            message.Title = "Title";
            
            message.ImageData=xxxx;
            message.ThumbData=xxxx;
            
            SendMessageToWX.Req req = new SendMessageToWX.Req(message, scene);
            var api = WXAPIFactory.CreateWXAPI("your app id ");
            await api.SendReq(req);
            }
            catch (WXException ex)
            {
            //do sth.
            }
The code above demonstrate how to share image to Wechat, and please MAKE SURE that ImageData and ThumbData are set up before send request to Wechat.
