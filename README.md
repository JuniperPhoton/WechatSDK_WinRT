# WechatSDK_WinRT

Attention: this project is **DONE**.
This project is generated by decompiling from Wechat SDK for WP8, which targets only to Windows Phone 8 Silverlight apps, and I just convert all the Silverlight API to Runtime version.

By using this SDK, please follow the steps(Assume that you are familar with Visual Studio):

1. Include MicroMsg.sdk in your Solution;
2. Add reference of MicrosoMsg.sdk to your Windows Phone project(Note that Windows 8.1 project is out of list);
3. In your .cs file: 

    using MicroMsg;

  try
            {
                int scene = SendMessageToWX.Req.WXSceneChooseByUser; //发给微信朋友

                var message = new WXImageMessage();
                message.Title = "Title";
               
                message.ImageData=xxxx;
                message.ThumbData=xxxx;
                 
                SendMessageToWX.Req req = new SendMessageToWX.Req(message, scene);
                var api = WXAPIFactory.CreateWXAPI("your app id ");
                await api.SendReq(req);
            }
            catch (WXException ex)
            {
                //do sth.
            }
